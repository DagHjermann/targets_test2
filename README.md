# targets_test2
Test scripts or learning the targets package  


1. Dynamic branching, part 2   
- second example of [the user manual chapter 15](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/dynamic.html)   
- using [row branching](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/dynamic.html#branching-over-row-groups)  
- 3 examples:  functions `group_by` and `tar_group`  
    - example 1: using 'group_by' and 'tar_group' (from 'targets' package)   
    - example 2: using 'tar_group_by' (from 'tarchetypes' package)
    - example 3: as above, but also reading parameters from file, and checking if you can re-run only branches for a specific row in the file (that seems not to work)
